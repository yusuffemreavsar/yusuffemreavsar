<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yusuf Emre</h2>

I am a graduate of Electronics and Communication Engineering. During my university life, I participated in various engineering clubs and received many seminars and professional training. I had opportunities to do internships in different fields related to my department. In the last years of my university life, I decided to improve myself in the software field due to my interest in software. After graduation, I tried to improve myself in the Web Programming. I improved myself by receiving many trainings related to this field. Currently, I continue to improve myself in this field by taking .Net Angular Fullstack training in the Istanbul Kodluyor project.
